I am a lazy person, if there is an easy way to complete a task I will find it. I like to think this carries into my work. I was able to cutdown on [multiple tasks through automation](https://hbzxc.github.io/projects/OfficeAutomation) sometimes freeing up hours of otherwise wasted time. I hope to get even better at having to do less. I’m not alone in this thinking either, people like having things done for them. Automating tasks in addition to being timesavers can also be enjoyable.

Sometimes it will get to a point where you’re [spending hours attempting to turn on a lightbulb](https://hbzxc.github.io/projects/AutoLight) while your friends and family grow ever more concerned at your inability to reach up and pull a cord. “Why doesn’t he use the switch? Polio was cured”, “please let me turn on the light I can’t see anything” these are the words of people who lack vision. Unable to see that spending time now will result in more time saved later (possible decades from now). There are a lot of things I want to do, none of them particularly well enough to make money so I need time to do these things while also being able to eat. I find one of the largest time sinks for coding in to be testing the code making sure it consistently works. If I can get better at writing the code, I can spend less time on bug fixing. I want to be able to take what I learn from this course and do less.

I don’t think that this is a controversial point to take just that most people don’t frame it in such a way. There is a reason most bureaucratic work takes place electronically now. I know bureaucracy and speed usually not used together without an adjective between them but imagine the DMV with all paper records. Having to sift through that mess by hand could make anyone go postal. People use technology all the time to enable a slothful lifestyle and I hope to contribute to that.
