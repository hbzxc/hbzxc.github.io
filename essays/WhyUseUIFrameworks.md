If you were on a leaking ship and bailing water with your hands and someone throws you a plastic cup. You would gladly take it since it does help. However a plastic cup is most likely not your first option. This is how I feel about working with html and UI frameworks. One is slightly better than the other but I would rather not use it at all (give me a pump). I am not making any websites to stand out but just convey information. For this there are multiple tools; WIX, squarespace, zyro, ukit the list goes on. All of these provide a graphical interface for placing elements, changing fonts, and previewing the site.

I’ve used WordPress to manage some websites and its very easy to grab a template and start editing it. You could do the same thing in pure HTML but previewing the changes takes much more time and its more prone to errors. Working with raw HTML does have the advantage of being more precise but most of these site building tools give you the option to edit the HTML directly if you want to tweak specific elements.

UI frameworks are steps above raw HTML in terms of ease of use but there are easier ways to get similar results. It is a good tool to have but personally I wouldn’t bother. Below are two sites that use wordpress both look good.
