I have an issue with the grading of this page for ICS214

This portion was taken for the Exam details

“The essays page should include at least 4 essays, one of which must be the [software engineering technical essay](https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f21/morea/final-project/experience-software-engineering-technical-essay.html). Apart from this required essay, you can write new ones, edit old ones, and delete ‘bad’ ones as long as at least 4 essays remain ...”

I don’t know why you would tell students to delete or change writings they think are “bad”. Those should be the ones left up. Being able to go back and review the work you’ve done and notice how terrible it is, that is a sign of growth and progress. Having those “bad” examples shows others that you have changed and improved and it pushes yourself to do better. I’d much rather see a profile with terrible early works that have gotten better than just only mediocre works. It looks stagnant like they haven’t grown at all. Also being able to contrast the terrible essays with the ones that seem good make them standout more.
