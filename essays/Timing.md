## Good Idea Bad Timing
RadGrad is a great Idea but as I’m in my final year it seems a bit late to have much of an impact. I had heard of RadGrad before, gets mentioned in class but no one explains what it is. I assume most people would be introduced to this tool in the introduction course. I did not take the introduction course at UH and as such did not use it till now. The experiences tab is a cool feature but I’m already working forty hours a week so I don’t have much time to really get into any of the interests. 

I do like and will use the course selection feature it is better than what UH has to offer. However I think that reflects more on how disjointed UH’s course catalogue is. I did not learn anything new from the RadGrad tutorial about computer science and if I did it did not leave an impression. I feel the same way about most of the course I have taken from UH. I’m tired of hearing “you will never use this” from the instructors.

I think that RadGrad is a good tool but it needs to be introduced early on. I only have three more classes to choose until I graduate and I at least have that many fingers so hopefully I can count those classes and avoid bandsaws. 

This essay is a bit short but I don’t have much to say about RadGrad. I won’t be using RadGrad not because its bad (I genuinely think it is a good tool) but because at this time I don’t have much use for this tool.
