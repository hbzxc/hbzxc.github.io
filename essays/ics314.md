## What is a Design Pattern?
Now that you are almost done with this class, I would like you to write on last essay that summarizes what you’ve learned about software engineering.

Because the technology stack for this class is designed for the creation of web applications, some students think this class is simply about web application development. Of course, web application development is a skill you’ve acquired in this class, but the more fundamental goal of this class is for you to acquire experience with fundamental software engineering concepts including:

Open Source Software Development
Configuration Management
Functional Programming
Development Environments
Coding Standards
User Interface Frameworks
Agile Project Management
Design Patterns
Ethics in Software Engineering
