I had a great smoothie while visting friends from a chain I had nver heard of, Tropical Smoothie cafe.

I wonder why I had never heard of it so I decided to map its locations out and see why I had never come across it.

I scraped their site using beautiful soup to get addresses. I also decided to scrape two other companies; Jamba Juice and  Smoothie King.

Tropical Smoothie Cafe locations: [https://locations.tropicalsmoothiecafe.com/index.html](https://locations.tropicalsmoothiecafe.com/index.html).

Jamba Juice Locations: [https://locations.jamba.com/](https://locations.jamba.com/).

Smoothie King Locations: [https://locations.smoothieking.com/site-map/us/](https://locations.smoothieking.com/site-map/us/).
