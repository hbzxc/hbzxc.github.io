In the game you are a farmer who needs to clear their field of a parasitic grass. 
If you fail to clear out enough your crops will die and you wonâ€™t make it through the winter

I was given a week to make a game in unity without importing any assets.
Everything was done in unity which uses C#

A duck was chosen as the controled character since the shape was simple to make.
I had previously implemented a slicing mechanic in a previous project and wanted to show that off since it was fun to use.



I made all of the assets including the sound and music.
